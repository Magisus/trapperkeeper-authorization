= Trapperkeeper-authorization

This clojure project is an authorization library for PuppetLabs Trapperkeeper based products.
It aims to port Puppet's `auth.conf` feature to clojure.

This is still a work in progress, currently missing some needed functionalities, among:
* auth.conf parsing
* ring handler
